# MSG Audit Tool
An audit tool for software projects based on the ISO/IEC 25010 specification.

Developed in the context of the AMOS Project in summer of 2020 @ FAU for the company msg.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with Angular. To set it up locally for development and testing do the following:

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Install the Angular CLI with npm: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. Clone this repository.
4. To start the application, run `ng serve` inside the cloned repo. The application can be accessed at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

We use VS Code for development. To apply our coding guidelines use the following plugins:
- Angular Language Service
- Angular Snippets
- Angular Rename Tag
- Prettier - Code Formatter (you have to manually enable it)
